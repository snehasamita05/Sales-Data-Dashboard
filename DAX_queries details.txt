1)  Total Invoiced Amount YTD vs Total Invoiced Amount Last YTD.
The Total Invoiced Amount YTD vs Total Invoiced Amount Last YTD compares the total sales (invoiced amount) of the current year up to the selected date (YTD - Year to Date) with the total sales of the same period from the previous year (Last YTD). This metric helps to analyze year-over-year performance, showing whether the invoiced amount has increased or decreased compared to the same timeframe last year.

Total Invoiced Amount Last YTD = 
CALCULATE(
    SUMX(
        Sales,
        Sales[Net Price] * Sales[Quantity]
    ),
    DATESYTD(DATEADD(DateTable[Date], -1, YEAR))
)

Total Invoiced Amount YTD = 
CALCULATE(
    SUMX(
        Sales,
        Sales[Net Price] * Sales[Quantity]
    ),
    DATESYTD(DateTable[Date])
)

4) New Customer On Date

New Customer on Date refers to the count of customers who made their first purchase on a specific date. It highlights the number of customers acquired on that particular day, helping to analyze customer acquisition trends and the impact of marketing or promotional activities on that specific day.

CardTitle = " On Date " & ([Selected Date])
New Customer Count = 
IF(
    ISBLANK([New Customers]), 
    "0", 
    FORMAT([New Customers], "0")  // Replace with desired format
)
New Customers = 
COUNTROWS(
    FILTER(
        Customer,
        YEAR([First Transaction Date]) = YEAR([Selected Date]) &&
        [First Transaction Date] = [Selected Date]
    )
)

First Transaction Date = 
CALCULATE(
    MIN(Sales[Invoice Date]),
    FILTER(
        ALL(Sales),  // Remove filters on the Sales table, but keep the CustomerKey context
        Sales[CustomerKey] = MAX(Customer[CustomerKey]) &&
        Sales[Invoice Date] <= SELECTEDVALUE(DateTable[Date])  // Compare with the selected date
    )
)
Selected Date = LASTDATE(DateTable[Date])

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
5) Top 5 customer
Top 5 Customers Based on Highest Order Amount refers to the five customers who have made the largest purchases within a specified period. This ranking is typically calculated based on the total order amount, allowing businesses to identify their highest-spending customers.

Order Amount = 
VAR SelectedDate = MAX(DateTable[Date])
RETURN
    CALCULATE(
        SUMX(Sales, Sales[Net Price] * Sales[Quantity]),  // Multiply Net Price by Quantity
        Sales[Invoice Date] <= SelectedDate  // Filter by the selected date
    )

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
6) Sales growth % by Country
Sales Growth % by Country measures the percentage change in sales over a specific period, broken down by country. It compares the sales performance of a given period (e.g., month or year) against a previous period, highlighting how each country's sales have increased or decreased.

% Sales Growth YTD = 
IF(
    ISBLANK([Total Invoiced Amount Last YTD]),
    0, -- Default to 0 if the previous year's value is blank
    DIVIDE(
        [Total Invoiced Amount YTD] - [Total Invoiced Amount Last YTD], 
        [Total Invoiced Amount Last YTD]
    ) * 100
)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7) % sales growth YTD with threshold
% Sales Growth YTD with Threshold represents the percentage change in sales for the year-to-date (YTD) compared to the same period in the previous year. Applying a threshold allows you to visually indicate performance that is above or below a certain benchmark or target.
% Sales Growth YTD = 
IF(
    ISBLANK([Total Invoiced Amount Last YTD]),
    0, -- Default to 0 if the previous year's value is blank
    DIVIDE(
        [Total Invoiced Amount YTD] - [Total Invoiced Amount Last YTD], 
        [Total Invoiced Amount Last YTD]

Month-by-Month Comparison: Actual vs Previous Year of Invoiced Amount shows how the invoiced amount for each month this year compares to the same month in the previous year, helping to track growth, identify trends, and assess performance over time.
Actual Year Invoiced Amount = 
SUMX(Sales, Sales[Net Price] * Sales[Quantity])  // Multiply Net Price by Quantity

Previous Year Invoiced = 
CALCULATE(
    SUMX(Sales, Sales[Net Price] * Sales[Quantity]),
    SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(DateTable[Date])
)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
9) Daily sales report
Daily Sales Report for Selected Month allows you to compare the ordered amount and invoiced amount on a daily basis within the selected month, providing insights into daily sales performance and identifying any discrepancies between what was ordered and invoiced.
Ordered Amount = SUMX(Sales, Sales[Unit Price] * Sales[Quantity])
Invoiced Amount = SUMX(Sales, Sales[Net Price] * Sales[Quantity])

Month Name = FORMAT(DateTable[Date], "MMMM")
Month Number = MONTH(DateTable[Date]) + (YEAR(DateTable[Date]) * 100)
Month-Year = FORMAT(DateTable[Date], "MM YYYY")
Year = YEAR(DateTable[Date])
